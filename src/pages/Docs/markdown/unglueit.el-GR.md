# Unglue.it Driver
Driver to retrieve metrics from the Unglue.it portal.

Install the driver as a package from PyPI by visiting the following link on [pypi][1].

Get the api key from: https://unglue.it/api/help

NOTE: The Unglue.it API doesnâ€™t support filtering by date and returns the total downloads for a given ISBN, so new downloads need to be calculated by comparing the API results to what we already have saved in the database.
