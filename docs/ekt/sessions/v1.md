# Εθνικό Κέντρο Τεκμηρίωσης Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
  A Book Session is a group of visits made by the same user within a continuous time frame. To record these sessions at EKT we use Google Analytics, and a session lasts until there are 30 minutes of inactivity; if a single user keeps interacting with the website within this time frame, multiple visits to the same book will be counted as one session. For more information on Google Analytics’ definition of a session read: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2731565">How a web session is defined in Analytics</a>.
