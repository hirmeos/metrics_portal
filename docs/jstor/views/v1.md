  <strong>Type <span class="tooltip"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> <span class="tooltiptext">Not all measures represent the same event, some platforms report the number of people who accessed a publication (e.g. users, session), others the number of times a resource was seen (e.g. views).
