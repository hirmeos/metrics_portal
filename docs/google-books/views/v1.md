<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
  Book Visits represent the total number of times a book has been accessed. This can include multiple visits by the same IP address, which are counted as separate visits. Google Books only reports back to the publisher the Book Visits and Book Page Views.
