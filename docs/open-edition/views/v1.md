# Open Edition Views Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
  Open Edition provides an HTML version of a book, where each chapter is provided in a separate page. This measure represents the total number of times a chapter has been accessed. This can include multiple visits by the same IP address, which are counted as separate visits. Open Edition reports are generated using <a href="https://www.awstats.org/">AWStats</a>.
