# Up-ga Sessions Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
Total sessions for the landing page of a work, as determined by Google Analytics. A Session is a group of visits made by the same user within a continuous time frame, and ends after 30 minutes of inactivity; if a single user keeps interacting with the website within this time frame, multiple visits to the same work will be counted as one session.
