# Up-ga Sessions Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
Total views of the landing page of a work, as determined by Google Analytics. In order for a subsequent view of the landing page from the same user to be counted, there must be a gap of at least 30 minutes from the last view of that landing page.
</div>

<strong>

For Example:
</strong>

<div style="color:black">
    <ul>
        <li>3:00pm - 1 view counted</li>
        <li>3:16pm [within 30 mins of last view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>3:33pm [within 30 mins of last view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>3:46pm [within 30 mins of last view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>4:02pm [within 30 mins of last view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>4:05pm [within 30 mins of last view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>4:39pm [more than 30 mins since last view] - 1 view counted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total views counted:<strong> 2</strong></p>
</div>
