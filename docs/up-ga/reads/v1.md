# Up-ga Reads Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
  Total views on pages where the work can be read, as determined by Google Analytics. To count multiple reads on the same page by the same user, there must be a gap of at least 30 minutes from the last read of that page, even if that previous read was not counted. NOTE: A read that occurs 2 hours after the first read will not be counted. See the last entry in the table below; it should be counted because it is 30 minutes after the last read, but because it is 2 hours after the first read, it is not counted.
</div>


<strong>
For Example:
</strong>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Time of visit</th>
        <th>Minutes from last visit</th>
        <th>Reads counted</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3:00 pm</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3:16 pm</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3:33 pm</td>
        <td>17</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3:46 pm</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4:02 pm</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4:05 pm</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4:39 pm</td>
        <td>34</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5:10 pm</td>
        <td>31</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>      
    <tr>
        <td><strong>TOTAL READS COUNTED</strong></td>
        <td></td>
        <td><strong>2</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>
