# Up-logs Sessions Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
Total views of the landing page of a work, as determined by processing the access logs (i.e. webserver logs) of the website. Multiple views of the same landing page by the same user within a rolling 30 minute window are counted as one.
</div>

<strong>

For Example:
</strong>

<div style="color:black">
    <ul>
        <li>3:00pm - 1 view counted</li>
        <li>3:16pm [within 30 mins of last counted view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>3:33pm [more than 30 mins since last counted view] - 1 view counted</li>
        <li>3:46pm [within 30 mins of last counted view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>4:02pm [within 30 mins of last counted view] - 0 views counted</li>
        <li>4:05pm [more than 30 mins since last counted view] - 1 view counted</li>
        <li>4:39pm [more than 30 mins since last counted view] - 1 view counted</li>
