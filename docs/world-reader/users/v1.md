# World Reader Measure

<div id="value-display"></div>
<strong>Description:</strong>
<div class="tile-1" style="text-align:center; color:black">
  World Reader is provided to users in the form of an app, making it easier to determine unique users accessing a particular publication (as opposed to sessions, or views). This measure represents the total number of unique users that accessed a book in the reported period, multiple visits to the same book from the same user will be counted as a single user.
